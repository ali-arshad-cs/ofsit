            <br><br><b> Why Healthcare Analytics?</b>
              <br><br>   Healthcare in the United States has gradually been emerging through three waves of data management: data collection, data sharing, and data analytics. So far, the data collection and sharing waves, categorized by the urgent placement of electronic health records and health information exchanges, have failed to significantly impact the quality and cost of healthcare. And even with the current publicity about big data (data structured and un-structured) being the next “big” thing in other industries, the reality in healthcare is that we are just beginning to have the necessary analytics capabilities that enable system-wide quality improvement and cost minimizing efforts. The actual potential of analytics lies in its capability to change healthcare into a truly data-driven culture.
              <br><br><b>  Healthcare Analytics Adoption Model:</b>
              <br><br>  Healthcare Analytics can be unclear, even prodigious without a systematized framework for guiding your approach and priorities. The following framework, called the Healthcare Analytics Adoption Model, was developed by a cross-industry group of healthcare industry experts as a guide to classifying groups of analytics abilities, and provide an organized sequencing to adopting analytics within health system organizations. An effective and maintainable analytics approach requires building initial elements of the model first in order to support the upper levels of the model in later years.
              <br><br><b>     Purpose:</b>
              <br><br>   The model borrows lessons learned from the HIMSS EMR Adoption Model, and describes an analogous approach for assessing the adoption of analytics in healthcare. The Healthcare Analytics Adoption Model provides:
              An outline for assessing the industry’s adoption of analytics.
              <br><br><b>    A framework for assessing vendor products.</b>
              A roadmap for organizations to measure their own development toward analytic adoption.
              It is believed that this Analytics Adoption Model will enable healthcare organizations to fully understand and control the capabilities of analytics and so achieve the final goal that has escaped most provider organizations – that of improving the quality of care while lowering costs and improving clinician and patient satisfaction.
              With the proper implementation of electronic health records (EHRs), many healthcare professionals for the first time got consolidated access to patient records. Now they're figuring out how to use all this information. Although the healthcare industry has been slow to delve into big data, that might be about to change. By using data properly not only money saved from more resourceful use of information, but also new research and treatments will be introduced and that's just the beginning of a new and highly effective process.
              For example, data from wireless, wearable devices such as FitBits is anticipated to eventually flood providers and insurers; by 2019, spending on wearable-data collection will reach $52 million, according to ABI Research. Another source of health data waiting to be analyzed: social media. Observing what people post can help fight insurance deceit and improve customer service.
              Having observed the impact that big data and analytics have on other markets -- and perhaps on competing healthcare organizations -- healthcare CEOs want to know how their organizations can use these tools. In a study, majority of healthcare CEOs said they were finding better ways to utilize and manage big data.
              Increasingly, Chief Information Officers can find similar organizations with experimental or full-scale projects. Forest Laboratories, for example, is collaborating with ConvergeHealth by Deloitte and Intermountain Healthcare on research to benefit patients with respiratory diseases. Using the collaborative, rapid-learning system developed by Intermountain and ConvergeHealth, Forest's researchers use OutcomesMiner analytics software to develop new treatments and therapeutic products and improve patient outcomes.
              In the meantime, some healthcare organizations already have plunged into big-data analytics, with impressive results.
              <br><br><b>    Benefits for Healthcare Industry:</b>
              <br><br> As this whole content is specific to healthcare so now the question arises that what benefits might be possible or can be obtained through health analytics….
              Health analytics incorporates the technologies and skills used to deliver business, clinical and programmatic insights into the complex interdependencies that drive medical outcomes, costs and oversight.
              Through modeling, optimization, predictive analytics and business intelligence, health care organizations can improve the way health care is conceived and deliver for better outcomes across areas of health industries:
              Health Analytics can mainly benefit four areas including doctors, public health, life sciences and healthcare plans.
              Providing regulatory bodies with evidence of drug safety and efficacy. Better understanding disease states. Improving manufacturing processes and sales and marketing efforts. Getting new medicines for patients faster. Identifying and devising the next generation of health care treatments. Identifying best plans to commercialize treatments.
              <br><br> Healthcare is changing and advancing rapidly and in this scenario advanced data management and predictive analytics enable data-driven decisions that will allow health plans to adapt to new market realities by fully understanding the new dynamics and applying them to their unique portfolios of business – from predicting and managing shifts in the customer base, to transitioning from a wholesale to a consumer marketplace, to bending the cost curve through health and condition management, to detecting and preventing deceit, and beyond.
              In this technologically advanced era where healthcare costs are also rising, health care providers have never had a greater need to derive trusted insights from data.
              From increasing patient safety, to improving the management and quality of care, to becoming more financially stable through efficiency and cost management, the use of advanced analytics is important.
              From multiple years health care providers have used data analytics to measure, track and improve performance more effectively and efficiently.
              <br><br>  Improve health outcomes and patient safety by providing evidence-based enhancements in quality of care.
              Save millions of dollars through accurate forecasting and real-time access to information. A lot of providers now a days can use data analytics for incentive based programs like HEDIS and PCMH which is beneficial both health care providers raising the rating of their practices and also improving the health of patients.
              While the cost to government of assisting a national health care system can be crippling, it can also result in health care transformation. With the goal of improving health care while lowering costs, policy makers are funding programs that encourage the sharing of data and adoption of electronic health records (EHRs).
              Governmental and non-governmental organizations collect and generate huge amounts of health care data. Clinical data combined with administrative data can be used to demonstrate if the money being spent to improve population health is actually working. And, as digital data streams grow, analytics will become more critical to manage costs and use scarce resources wisely.
              In order to conclude the whole topic we had say that data analytics is a sub part of data management. With having so much big amount of data both structured and unstructured it is very important to understand and most necessarily getting benefits from relevant data.

                    <br><br><b>A missed call means missed opportunity. </b>At caller’s end it will go unanswered call
                    but at your end it will be a missed call. Whether it was a new query from a potential customer or a
                    follow-up call from an existing customer who wanted to place another order, the call that you just
                    failed to pick up could affect your bottom line. It is not possible to say with any certainty just
                    how much money any particular missed call will cost your firm but we can tell you that the
                    consequences will surely frighten you if unanswered calls are a regular occurrence in your office.
                    These lines are for the companies which are just doing normal everyday businesses.
                    <br><br><b>Bigger responsibility at our end.</b> But if we come to the perspective of a business
                    which is related to hospitals/healthcare then the loss of missed call is even bigger. It can affect
                    both money and your rapport. When we talk about healthcare then callers are not just normal callers
                    wanting to order a food delivery or calling to place an order for a decoration piece, the callers in
                    this industry are calling most of the times with their specific and very significant needs and
                    expect that the persons on the other end are responsible and on their toes to help them out.
                    <br><br><b> Dent on trust is not acceptable.</b> We are hospitals, group practices, solo
                    practitioners etc. etc. Whatever we do in these areas we have to be very accurate, honest and
                    impartial. Our clients should trust us and don’t assume by their unanswered calls that we are just
                    sitting inactive on company’s clock. Healthcare industry requires highest degree of trust and missed
                    calls can put a dent on this trust which is not acceptable. And definitely is this is the case then
                    the damage on the client and your relationship is very much possible.
                    <br><br><b>Unanswered calls causing problems.</b> Now just look at the problems you could have if
                    the calls go unanswered. Your employees could be spending time at work dealing with complaints that
                    arise because of failure to answer a call. If patients experience an increased frequency of
                    unanswered calls then they might start thinking to switch from your healthcare services which is not
                    only bad in terms of losing that patient but it could also affect your practice when this attitude
                    of your front desk or anyone with the phone answering responsibility has been told to other people,
                    this has been surveyed that people talk about receiving bad services more than receiving good
                    services.
                    <br><br><b> Outcomes of your efforts.</b> It is believed that along with effective treatment
                    trusting a doctor is very essential both of these factors contribute in healing of the patient.
                    Failure to achieve a nice percentage of healed or satisfied patients will not only demotivate you
                    but it will demotivate your staff as well. We can easily see here that just this minute factor of
                    answering the calls properly is so important and could build or destroy outcomes of your efforts.
                    <br><br><b>NCQA Requirements.</b> An important factor is also there that NCQA (National Committee
                    for Quality Assurance) which is an independent non-profit organization and demands your medical
                    practices to be more patient centric than ever. This also requires to be very helpful for the
                    patients and be very responsive to them, so this also increase the need for your answering services.
                    <br><br><b>Some Statistics.</b> In this world where more than 70% people have smartphones and now
                    more searches took place on phones rather than computers, patients find it really easy to search for
                    their needs and call right away without wasting time. Keeping this scenario in mind when a new
                    patient searches for your practice and finds that no one answered the phone then around 85% chances
                    are there that he or she will not call again and will look for another facility. This is really bad
                    for the services and reputation of your practice.
                    <br><br><b>Another very important thing is to find the source of unanswered calls.</b> Sometimes
                    it’s not the fault of front desk. It could be the mismanagement of the work flow or the incoming
                    calls overflow i.e. the ratio of staff to the patients is not appropriate. This factor of
                    determining root cause is also important because by this it’s easy to eradicate the problem instead
                    of hitting and trying random solutions.
                    <br><br><b> Real Talk.</b> Phone calls are so important that even with so many platforms of queries
                    now a days, where e-mails and social media messages are also present but still 80% of real talk gets
                    done over phones. If we talk about appointments from new or even existing patients phone has their
                    great importance.
                    <br><br><b> Effective solutions.</b> If you are having this problem of unanswered calls from your
                    end and not worried about it, then we suggest you to take proper actions and not to worry at all
                    because this is where we can help you. In this technologically advanced world where so many ways of
                    communication are present we can offer you with a variety of options and you can choose whatever
                    suits you best.
                    <br><br> <b> Automated Systems.</b> There are many things that can be done. It’s your choice whether
                    you want to do it in house or outsource it. In house requires automated systems of answering calls.
                    The automated system will help you in reducing costs as well as better answering services. It can
                    also help you in forwarding or diverting calls to the rights persons. IVR is usually used in this
                    process. But here comes a problem with it as well. Mostly when an automated systems receives a call
                    and the concerned person is not available then your caller has to record the message and studies
                    show that 50% of the caller don’t record message even if you have that recording option available on
                    your system! This indicates that this solution is not even very effective and even if you have
                    automated answering systems and voice mails even then your employees have to backtrack the record
                    and deal with the voice mails and unanswered calls.
                    <br><br> <b> What suits you best?</b> The best solution which we recommend in this regard is that
                    there should be someone dedicated for answering calls as this is a very serious matter as mentioned
                    above. The cost may or may not go higher but the results would be extremely effective, plus if a
                    real person answers the phone almost every time then its effective and much full filling than
                    automated answering systems. If you don’t want anyone to sit permanently in your office for this
                    service and obviously that is expensive to pay someone just for answering the phones then you can
                    easily outsource it, and if we are recommending it then we can definitely help you with it. We can
                    provide you with dedicated services even in early hours, lunch hours and after office hours.<br><br> The
                    services can be customized and tailored according to your needs with a lot of options suiting you
                    best. To discuss or ask any question you may have, you can dial 212-470-1500.
